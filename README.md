Simulations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms

File MCMC.ipynb simulates an exponential distribution.

Files MCMC_Ising-Model.ypinb and MCMC_Ising-Model_N=250.ypinb simulate grids of spins of size 20x20 or 250x250 distributed according to Boltzmann distribution.
Graph shows the mean magnetization of first n grids generated by algorithm.
